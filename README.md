# OCR PROJECT
## Object character recognition

Many system uses ocr to recognize characters , for example key cards , atm machine and cashie card swiping devices uses ocr to recognize characters
in this project have used django and javascript to detect the text in an image captured by the camera

### Main aim
the main aim of this project is to use a mobile camera to scan , lets say special access cards with codes to authenticate a person into the system
Given resources you can extend this project and integrate it with some devices such as office doors, locks ,card system
and even gate system to scan the access card to grant access if authenticated
